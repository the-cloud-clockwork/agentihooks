**Time each read inside the tick idle watch**

This change wraps each individual read inside the tick's idle watch step with timing.timed, so instead of a single opaque 3.5-second span per agent, the tick step records separately name the refusal check, pane state write, outage handling, heartbeat waits, ledger probe hold, and similar reads, letting the slowest one be identified by its median duration. It matters because the reap step was burning roughly 3.5 seconds of wall time per agent on under 0.2 seconds of actual CPU work, and this instrumentation is the needed diagnostic groundwork for finding and fixing that bottleneck without changing any behavior itself.
