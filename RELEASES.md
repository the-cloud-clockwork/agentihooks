**Invalidate cached plan verdicts after task text changes**

This change fixes a bug where editing a task's title or description could leave stale, now-invalid plan verdicts in place. Rewrites now properly invalidate cached intent plan checks and traced verdicts, while unchanged text and plans continue reusing their existing verdicts for efficiency. Incremental tracing re-checks the earlier prefix against the current task text, and the build gate reads from the same task-bound digest, closing five reproduced stale-verdict cases. Existing plans will need one fresh trace after upgrading to pick up this fix.

**Read independent hive token credentials before changing issuance**

This change updates `auth.agent_member` so it can read independent hive token records alongside the existing legacy two-field member scopes, checking exact ledger and agent scope and validating current ledger membership for revocation, while issuance logic itself remains untouched. This read-compatibility step must be deployed to every verifier before the upcoming writer change that actually migrates tokens to independent records, ensuring a safe rolling deployment without breaking verification mid-rollout. Tests confirm correctness, including mutant coverage and intended reader regression failures, with Standards and Spec readers both reconfirming pass status.

**Map common ends of long repeated modules before diffing coverage lines**

The ratchet’s line_map was running Python’s difflib SequenceMatcher over entire files, and on files with thousands of identical lines its longest-match search scaled quadratically, pushing runs past the ten-second budget and causing a flaky test that only passed on retry. This change has line_map first identify and map the common prefix and suffix of the files directly, then run the matcher only on the remaining changed middle section, cutting measured runtime from several seconds (up to 11.58s under load) down to under a millisecond for the repeated-line case while keeping results correct and the budget intact.

**Time each read inside the tick idle watch**

This change wraps each individual read inside the tick's idle watch step with timing.timed, so instead of a single opaque 3.5-second span per agent, the tick step records separately name the refusal check, pane state write, outage handling, heartbeat waits, ledger probe hold, and similar reads, letting the slowest one be identified by its median duration. It matters because the reap step was burning roughly 3.5 seconds of wall time per agent on under 0.2 seconds of actual CPU work, and this instrumentation is the needed diagnostic groundwork for finding and fixing that bottleneck without changing any behavior itself.
