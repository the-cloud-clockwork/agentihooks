# CI lab service contract
{: .no_toc }

The CI lab runs as two services, the scheduler and the worker. This page lists what each one
exposes and reads: its entry point, environment, ports and metric names. Every name lives in
`scripts.ci_lab.contract`; the services and the platform tests are to import these constants by
name, so a rename fails an import instead of dropping a series.

## Entry points

| Command | Module form | What it does today |
|---|---|---|
| `agentihooks ci-lab-scheduler --self-test` | `python -m scripts.ci_lab scheduler --self-test` | Checks the scheduler contract offline and prints it as JSON |
| `agentihooks ci-lab-worker --self-test` | `python -m scripts.ci_lab worker --self-test` | Refuses any GitHub App variable, checks the worker contract offline and prints it as JSON |

The self tests make no network, Redis, object store or GitHub calls. They exit 0 when the
contract holds and 1 with the reason on standard error when it does not. A self test fails when
a metric name is not a valid Prometheus name starting with `ci_lab_`, a port repeats or falls
outside 1 to 65535, or the worker environment grants `GITHUB_APP_`. Without `--self-test` the
command exits 2: the service loops come with the scheduler and worker tasks.

## Environment

| Name | Scheduler | Worker | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AGENTIHOOKS_BUS*` | yes | yes | Event bus connection settings |
| `CI_LAB_MINIO_*` | yes | yes | Object store endpoint, bucket and credentials, passed by reference |
| `GITHUB_APP_*` | yes | never | GitHub App identity used to post check runs |
| `CI_LAB_REDIS_URL` | yes | no | Queue, lease and verdict index store |
| `CI_LAB_RUNTIME_CONFIG` | yes | no | Path of the mounted runtime config; `python -m scripts.ci_lab runtime <path>` validates it |
| `CI_LAB_SCHEDULER_URL` | no | yes | Base address of the scheduler lease API |
| `CI_LAB_SLOTS` | no | yes | Number of units the worker runs at once |
| `CI_LAB_GIT_MIRROR` | no | yes | Path of the shared git mirror the worker cuts worktrees from |
| `UV_CACHE_DIR` | no | yes | Shared uv cache for virtual environments |

A worker started with any `GITHUB_APP_*` variable in its environment refuses to start. It exits
1 and names each variable it found. Only the scheduler holds the App key.

## Ports

| Port | Service | Serves |
|---|---|---|
| `8800` | scheduler | The lease API workers call, and `/capacity` |
| `9108` | scheduler and worker | Prometheus metrics |

`METRICS` maps each name to its label names. Environment names have constants too:
`BUS_PREFIX`, `MINIO_PREFIX`, `GITHUB_APP_PREFIX`, `REDIS_URL`, `RUNTIME_CONFIG`,
`SCHEDULER_URL`, `SLOTS`, `GIT_MIRROR` and `UV_CACHE_DIR`, with `SCHEDULER_PORT` and
`METRICS_PORT` for the ports.
