# Tests workflow timing

Last ten runs of the Tests workflow on dev (35380163028, 35379942561, 35379468297, 35156774129, 35156548701, 35156299806, 35155214526, 35138446531, 35138276256, 35137837913). Seconds per step, mean and max over those runs.

| Job | Step | Mean | Max | Slowest run |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| unit (3.12) | Run tests | 39.6 | 41 | 35155214526 |
| unit (3.11) | Run tests | 34.1 | 41 | 35156774129 |
